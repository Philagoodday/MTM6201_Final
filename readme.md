# My challenge:
1. First item First, the challenge I faced was to find a CSS framework other than Bootstrap that was compatible with my files. After looking for more than a dozen frameworks, I finally found the animation assets of cdn.jsdelivr.net, which enriched the visual effects of my webpage.

2. Second, it was too troublesome to set up responsive images, so I only used them on some pictures. Because setting up responsive images is too boring QwQ, I think I should be more patient, which is also a skill I need to improve in the future.

3. Third, when I used SVG, the thickness of the line seemed to be unable to be dynamically controlled, and I finally abandoned some effects.

4. Fourth, I encountered some difficulties when adding background colors, probably because I did not fully master the color control of bootstrap.

## About the copyright of property: I used the CSS framework assets of cdn.jsdelivr.net and bootstrap. Google's font family. All pictures and icons were taken by myself. Also I got the permisson of them. You can check those photos on my instagram (About-> My ins).

### In short, after practicing this final assignment, I have a better understanding of my web development skills. At the same time, I was also impressed by the logical operation of HTML and CSS. For me, I feel very satisfied. Finally, I would like to thank Professor Max for his teaching and dedication this semester. You are a very patient teacher. Thank you!
